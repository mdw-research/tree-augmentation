# Tree Augmentation
An empirical analysis is performed on several approximation algorithms for the unweighted version of the Tree Augmentation Problem (TAP). We contrast the algorithms using space, time, solution quality, and ease of implementation metrics.

## Dependencies and Installation
#### Networkx v3.3
#### OpenSSL v1.1

### Install with Conda
- `conda create --name myenv python=3.10`
- `conda activate myenv`
- `conda install -c conda-forge networkx=3.3`

Our exact algorithm uses CPLEX and AMPL:
